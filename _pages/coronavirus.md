*May 1, 2020*

To our family and friends:

First and foremost, we pray that you all are doing well. It’s been such a whirlwind of a year so far, and the past couple months have been significantly different from what we anticipated. 

With that said, we have received many questions regarding our wedding, as the COVID-19 situation continues to change and travel plans are up in the air.

For the safety of our guests, we have decided to postpone our wedding to **next summer, 2021.** We are working to figure out our new date and will keep you informed as soon as we have our updated plan finalized.

Both hotel accommodations and airlines are mostly offering lenient ticket change policies, so we suggest reaching out to them directly.

While we are sad to delay our celebration and cause changes to your plans, the safety of our loved ones is our utmost priority. We will post updates to our website and also send out updates via email. 

Please contact us directly with any questions. Thank you for your love, patience, and concern. We cannot wait to celebrate with you all!

❤️,

**P.S.**  
To those wondering about our future plans, we do have a couple updates. We *will* still be moving overseas to Scotland at the end of this summer. Rebekah’s program will start virtually for the first six weeks in August, and in-person classes will begin at the end of September. Josiah has signed a full time job offer in Edinburgh (praise the Lord!) and will start in October.
