To our family and friends:

We hope you are all doing well and staying healthy. Though this year has been full of ups and downs, we are enjoying our life in Scotland and have been truly blessed through this first year of marriage.

As we’ve been watching the pandemic situation unfold over the past year, we have decided to cancel our original wedding plans out of an abundance of caution towards the health and safety of our loved ones. We would still like to have some kind of celebration in the future, but the what and when remains to be seen. 

Ultimately, it just didn’t make sense to have a large gathering and we didn’t want to filter down our guest list. While we know this is disappointing, we hope you can understand why this was the best decision for us.

On the bright side, we held a small backyard wedding with our immediate family on the original date (June 27th, 2020). While we weren’t able to have the ceremony we initially planned, we were incredibly grateful to have a strong start to our marriage. This was actually our second ceremony, as we obtained our marriage certificate last February on our 4th anniversary when we started our UK visa process. 

Again, please feel free to contact us with questions. We are so appreciative of you all and send our love! 

❤️,

**P.S.**  
We just released a short update video on how things have been for us recently. The big news is that we have just bought our first house here in Edinburgh! We’d love to have some visitors when international travel starts to open up.

To our family and friends:

First and foremost, we pray that you all are doing well. It’s been such a whirlwind of a year so far, and the past couple months have been significantly different from what we anticipated. 

With that said, we have received many questions regarding our wedding, as the COVID-19 situation continues to change and travel plans are up in the air.

For the safety of our guests, we have decided to postpone our wedding to **next summer, 2021.** We are working to figure out our new date and will keep you informed as soon as we have our updated plan finalized.

Both hotel accommodations and airlines are mostly offering lenient ticket change policies, so we suggest reaching out to them directly.

While we are sad to delay our celebration and cause changes to your plans, the safety of our loved ones is our utmost priority. We will let you know of any other updates, and will also plan to redo the RSVP process once the time comes. 

Please contact us directly with any questions. Thank you for your love, patience, and concern. We cannot wait to celebrate with you all!

❤️,

**P.S.**  
To those wondering about our future plans, we do have a couple updates. We *will* still be moving overseas to Scotland at the end of this summer. Rebekah’s program will start virtually for the first six weeks in August, and in-person classes will begin at the end of September. Josiah has signed a full time job offer in Edinburgh (praise the Lord!) and will start in October.
