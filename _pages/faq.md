### How/when do I RSVP?
Please RSVP using the link on the top of this site by the date listed on your invitation. You can also click [here](../rsvp){:target="_blank"}.

### Do I have to RSVP? Can't I just tell you I'm going to be there (or not)?
 Yes. Please RSVP.

### What will the weather be like?
SLO is known for its warm and sunny weather, so we're expecting temperatures from low to high 70s. It gets a little colder once the sun sets, but nothing too crazy. We recommend dressing in layers or bringing an extra jacket just in case! [Here](https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/san-luis-obispo-ca/93401/june-weather/331999){:target="_blank"}
 is last year's forecast around this time in SLO.

### Where should I stay?
We have a list of nearby hotels on our [Accommodations](../accommodations){:target="_blank"} page, but SLO also has a wide variety of options available including great Airbnbs. 

### Can I park at the venue?
Yes. There is plenty of parking, but carpooling is always encouraged.

### Can I bring my kids?
Because of the nature of our wedding and venue, we will be having an adults only ceremony and reception. Please contact us if you have questions!

### What if I have a dietary restriction?
If you have specific concerns or allergies, please make sure to mention it in your RSVP. Contact us if you have additional concerns.

### Will alcohol be served?
Yes.

### Can I bring a plus one?
Unfortunately there is a limit on the guests we can invite. We have listed the names of those invited specifically on the invitation. If you feel we left out someone important, let us know, but understand that our limitations may mean our hands are tied.

### When is the wedding?
June 27, 2020. The ceremony will start at 2pm.

### When should I arrive?
We hope you'll take the time to spend your weekend in SLO if you have the chance! Check out our [accommodations](../accommodations){:target="_blank"} page for a few of our recommended spots around the city. If you're driving up Saturday morning, it takes about 3.5 hours from both the Bay Area or LA.

With that being said, plan to arrive at the venue by 1:45pm to park and find a seat. There's generally no traffic around SLO, and our venue is about 12 minutes away from downtown SLO. Please plan accordingly!

### Where is the wedding?
The ceremony and reception will be held at Castle Noland.

### Will the wedding be indoors or outdoors?
Our wedding will be outdoors. There will be a chance to check out the inside of the castle (which is super cool), but plan to be outside for most of the time. See the question on weather.

### Is there a wedding hashtag?
Yep! Feel free to use [#HandranToPang](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/HandranToPang/){:target="_blank"} to help share your night with us and others!

### Can I take pictures?
We have paid for professional photography to capture how the wedding looks, but we have invited you so you may capture how it feels. Use our [hashtag](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/HandranToPang/){:target="_blank"}! We ask you silence your electronics during our ceremony to ensure you are in the moment. Some of these photos will be posted online afterwards for your viewing purposes.

### Where are you registered?
Check out our [Registry](../registry){:target="_blank"} page for more information!

### What do I do if something changes and I can/can't make it after I have RSVPed?
We understand things come up. Just contact us right away so we can make changes.

### Will there be dancing?
Yes.

### I have more questions!
