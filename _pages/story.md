# Our Story

Rebekah and I wanted to have a place to share more about our story, including how we met to where we'll be heading after the wedding.  While this is just an overview of our nearly ten years together, we'd love to talk more in person if you're curious!

We've broken our story into three chronological parts: Our Past, Our Present, and Our Future. We also thought it would be fun to share more about the proposal and include a video for those who couldn't make it, so that's the last section.

**R:** Josiah and I have been at the same school since preschool, but our story begins in the percussion section in junior high band. For those of you who know, percussion can get a little boring sometimes while counting rests that we took the opportunity to get to know each other. As awkward pre-teens we slowly built a friendship, joking with each other and sharing about our interests. Josiah was the first to introduce me to *Doctor Who*, *The Office*, and Coldplay, all of which are still my favorites today. We grew up together, went to school dances together, and really got to play a big role in each others lives, shaping us into the people we are today. He was and will always be my best friend.

We started dating my junior year of high school; he asked me to be his girlfriend on February 6th, 2016, the day I took my ACT. From there, Josiah went off to college at Cal Poly, and we were long distance for a year. Though it was rough, I think it really challenged our relationship and helped us grow closer and stronger. When it was time for me to choose a college, I really wanted a school with a great Animal Science program, a strong fellowship and community, and  nice weather; Cal Poly checked all of my boxes. I’m very blessed that God provided a place for us to both thrive in our majors, serve together, and just be in the same place at the same time.

## Our Present

**J:** God continued to be faithful to us as we stepped into our first taste of adulthood. Like Rebekah said, I started college a year before she did, choosing to study Computer Science and Entrepreneurship at Cal Poly in the fall of 2016. I quickly found a home away from home with Cru in Epic, an Asian-American fellowship at many university campuses. The mix of new challenges academically and socially truly forced me to redefine my faith and choose to pursue faith for myself. At the intersection of career and faithfulness, choosing the latter has brought only joy and provision.

When Rebekah eventually chose to study at Cal Poly a year later, real and genuine community is what grew our faith and ultimately our relationship. Before college, our relationship very much felt like our own and isolated from others. Choosing to bring others into our lives and our relationship helped us work on the things that would have the most long term impact. 

I realized how much I sucked at long distance, so we spent much of the 2017-18 school year stepping back to rebuild our relationship. Just like strong and healthy vine must have their branches pruned to bear good fruit, strong biblical relationships must endure the work of [pruning](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/god-prunes-those-he-loves/){:target="_blank"} to expose the areas of our hearts that need work.

Through the ups and downs, we’ve really learned to cherish and value the opportunities to grow closer to one another and Christ through conflict leading to conflict resolution. Living in community has played an immense role in our relationship, and we’re so thankful for the lifelong friends we’ve made both in and out of the classroom.

## Our Future

**R:** Like I said previously, Cal Poly has an incredible Animal Science program and I have loved every minute of it. From baby horse care to dairy product judging to marine mammal rescuing, I have truly been living the dream of my five-year-old self. One of the main reasons I chose Cal Poly was because of their sister school exchange program with a school in Scotland called *The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies at the University of Edinburgh*. 

I applied as a second year and was accepted into their program and will be attending for the next four years, beginning in *August 2020*. Josiah and I are thrilled to be starting our lives together in a new country and very excited for what adventures and challenges this next chapter will bring.   

**J:** I never imagined starting the post grad life overseas let alone in Scotland, a country I confused with Ireland before looking at a map. God has really used this opportunity to challenge me in my faith to give up the things I saw as valuable or desirable. 

I’ll be graduating with my degree in June 2020. In the meantime, I’m in the process of searching for a full time position in the software industry in Edinburgh. Career has always been my outlet to express who I am and what my passions are. My next challenge is finding where this intersects with what I’ll be called to do in Scotland. 

Like Rebekah mentioned, we’re so excited for this new journey and hope to share glimpses of that with you for the next four years. Hit us up if you’re in Europe!

## The Proposal

**J:** I’d say I knew Rebekah was the one after maybe about a year of dating. We’ve been incredibly blessed to have had the chance to essentially grow up with one another, something not many couples get to experience. We had already known each other for over five years at that point, so we were just trying to keep on an upward growth trajectory. 

I decided in spring 2019 that I would propose the coming fall, and told myself I’d plan the proposal over the summer. After assembling my dream team with Grace and Kolson, we set to work hashing out the details of the day.

We chose Sunday, September 15th, the first day we would all be back in SLO. Because Grace is a photographer (An amazing one too. Hire her!), she would suggest the four of us could “scout” a new location to help her out and catch up from the summer. I went down to SLO for a weekend over the summer to “help Kolson move into a new place”, but we also had the chance to check out the location beforehand to plan out timings and specifics. Not suspicious at all. 

Once our details were set, things became real when I created a massive group chat, inviting all our friends to the big day with [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ht7GefrHaOUAoL2y7DR8Dw2gOdlOlsYUgV1svBoAREc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} document. No backing out now.

I was so nervous the day of. Part of the plan was actually hanging out, taking pictures, and catching up for about an hour leading up to the proposal. You can tell by some of the “before” pictures I wasn’t exactly at ease. 

Despite all that, things went way better than expected the day of. We arrived on schedule, had the chance to actually hang out and catch up, and I found the right moment to pop the question. Thanks to Timmy, who was keeping an eye out for our white umbrella picture (which also doubled as the signal), our family and friends found their way to the location, and Rebekah had no idea any of this was happening. 

We’d love to share some moments with you, whether you could be there or not. I handed Kolson my phone and asked him to record my “1 second everyday” video, and he got the whole thing on camera. He also filmed a couple moments from his perspective throughout the afternoon, which I found too funny not to share as well.
