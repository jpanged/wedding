Rebekah and I wanted to have a place to share more about our story, including how we met to where we'll be heading after the wedding. We've broken our story into three parts: Our Past, Our Present, and Our Future. While this is just an overview of our nearly ten years together, we'd love to talk more in person if you're curious!

## Our Past
**R:** Josiah and I have been at the same school since preschool, but our story begins in the percussion section in junior high band. For those of you who know, percussion can get a little boring sometimes while counting rests that we took the opportunity to get to know each other. As awkward pre-teens we slowly built a friendship, joking with each other and sharing about our interests. Josiah was the first to introduce me to Doctor Who, The Office, and Coldplay, all of which are still my favorites today. We grew up together, went to school dances together, and really got to play a big role in each others lives, shaping us into the people we are today. He was and will always be my best friend.

We started dating my junior year of high school; he asked me to be his girlfriend on February 6th, 2016, the day I took my ACT. From there, Josiah went off to college at Cal Poly, and we were long distance for a year. Though it was rough, I think it really challenged our relationship and helped us grow closer and stronger. When it was time for me to choose a college, I really wanted a school with a great Animal Science program, a strong fellowship and community, and  nice weather; Cal Poly checked all of my boxes. Iâ€™m very blessed that God provided a place for us to both thrive in our majors, serve together, and just be in the same place at the same time.
