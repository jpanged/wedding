        <h3>Grace Khieu</h3>
        <p>I met Rebekah through Josiah when she came to Cal Poly, but after a couple of good conversations during her first fall quarter, we ended up hanging out every week and I eventually started discipling her. We would read and go through content together, but my favorite parts of discipleship were the times where we would just talk about our weeks and spill the tea! I really love cats because they are the perfect companion, and often find myself being like oneâ€”sleeping a lot and sometimes being a little sassy.</p>
