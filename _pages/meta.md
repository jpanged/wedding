This site was created using Jekyll with hosting on GitHub Pages. It's based on Minimal Mistakes.

When I (Josiah) initially set out to build our wedding website, I researched different "site builder" options like Squarespace and The Knot. I ultimately decided to stick with my roots and make something entirely our own to keep it unique and also use the fonts and colors we chose to brand the wedding with.

This project allowed me to dive deeper into front end development and put my HTML/CSS knowledge into practice. Through media queries and flexboxes, I was able to accomplish responsiveness without any fancy logic.
