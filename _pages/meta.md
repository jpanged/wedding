This site was created using Jekyll with hosting on GitHub Pages. It's based on Minimal Mistakes.

When I (Josiah) initially set out to build our wedding website, I researched different "site builder" options like Squarespace and The Knot. I ultimately decided to stick with my roots and make something entirely our own to keep it unique and also use the fonts and colors we chose to brand the wedding with.

This project allowed me to dive deeper into front end development and put my HTML/CSS knowledge into practice. Through media queries and flexboxes, I was able to accomplish responsiveness without any fancy logic. 

The goal was to create a light and minimal yet information rich website to act as a virtual home for our wedding. We wanted to showcase our love story as well as share moments throughout our time together. 

In the months leading up to the wedding, our hope was for the website to have all the information and details to answers questions our guests might have. Additionally, we created a place to share our story and highlights some of our favorite pictures over the years. 

For the day of the wedding, the website will continue to serve its informational purpose by hosting relevant information to the event in a new section. From having the schedule to table assignments, we hope to eliminate paper waste and save money by using a virtual platform.
